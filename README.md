# test-nan
test native abstraction for nodeJs 

Start point is https://github.com/nodejs/nan/tree/master/examples/async_pi_estimate.
But as I cann't clone that bit only I started won projects

The aim is to managed to fathom how passing string from JavaScript to C works and how to invoke a callback with a string response back

It should be easy but corrent documentation within nan project is rather confusing
